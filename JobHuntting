Last month when I finnaly relized I need a new job for myself and my family, I start to ask my friends for some advice. And I got 2 times for interview, but failed at last. My skills are somehow out of time, and I find there a long way to learning. So I made up my mind to learn something new and chanlleged, c++11 and freelock programming first, for I had try them for a short time once.
